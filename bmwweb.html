						<h2><span>BMW</span></h2>
						<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə] ( German for Bavarian Motor Works),
						usually known under its abbreviation BMW (German pronunciation: [ˈbeːˈʔɛmˈveː] ( listen)),
						is a German luxury vehicle, motorcycle, and engine manufacturing company founded in 1916.
						Headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. BMW owns Mini cars and is the parent company of 
						Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. BMW produces motorcars under the BMW Motorsport division and
						motorcycles under BMW Motorrad, and plug-in electric cars under the BMW i sub-brand and 
						the "iPerformance" model designation within the regular BMW lineup. It is one 
						of the best-selling luxury automakers in the world.
						The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4]</p>

						<h2><span>History</span></h2>
						<p>BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the 
						Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end of World War 
						I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the 
						Versailles Armistice Treaty. The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production
						as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923, followed by automobiles 
                         in 1928–29.
                                   The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
                              BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in 
							  the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau . 
							  Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power 
							  plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed 
							  version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). 
							  The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs 
							  competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.
							  Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, 
                            the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.</p>

						<h2><span>Production</span></h2>
						<p>In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.
						In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).
                        The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna of Canada, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973
						were produced in 2009. Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at BMW US Manufacturing Company, Greer, South Carolina.
                        It is reported that about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines.
						Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.
						BMW also has local assembly operation using complete knock down components in Thailand, Russia,
                           Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.</p>
