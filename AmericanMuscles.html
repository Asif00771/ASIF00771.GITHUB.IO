						<h2><span>American Muscles</span></h2>
						<p>Muscle car is an American term used to refer to a variety of high-performance automobiles.
						The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines muscle cars as "any of a group of American-made 2-door sports cars
						with powerful engines designed for high-performance driving."
						A large V8 engine is fitted in a 2-door, rear wheel drive, family-style
						mid-size or full-size car designed for four or more passengers. Sold at an 
						affordable price, muscle cars are intended for street use and occasional drag racing.They are 
						distinct from two-seat sports cars and expensive 
						2+2 GTs intended for high-speed touring and road racing.</p>

					<div class="column">
						<h2><span>Etymology</span></h2>
						<p>According to Muscle Cars, a book written by Peter Henshaw, a 
						"muscle car" is "exactly what the name implies. It is a product
						of the American car industry adhering to the hot rodder's philosophy of 
						taking a small car and putting a large-displacement engine in it. 
						The Muscle Car is Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face of the 98 horsepower weakling.
						"Henshaw further asserts that the muscle car was designed for straight-line speed, 
						and did not have the "sophisticated chassis", "engineering integrity", 
						or "lithe appearance" of European high-performance cars.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<h2><span>Histroy</span></h2>
						<p>Opinions on the origin of the muscle car vary, but the 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88,
						created in response to public interest in speed and power, is often cited as the first
						muscle car. It featured America's first high-compression overhead valve V8 in the smaller, 
						lighter Oldsmobile 76/Chevy body for
						six-cylinder engines (as opposed to bigger Olds 98 luxury body).
                         Jack Nerrad wrote in Driving Today, "the Rocket V-8 set the standard for
						 every American V-8 engine that would follow it for at least three decades
						 With a displacement of 303 cubic inches and topped by a two-barrel carburetor,
						 the first Rocket V-8 churned out 135 hp (101 kW; 137 PS) at 3,600 rpm and 263 
						 pound force-feet (357 N·m) of torque at a lazy 1800 rpm [and] no mid-range car in 
						 the world, except the Hudson Hornet, came close to the Rocket Olds performance potential..."</p>
