						<h2><span>Ferrari</span></h2>
						<p><br>Ferrari S.p.A. (pronounced [ferˈrari]) is an Italian sports car manufacturer
						based in Maranello. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the
						company built its first car in 1940. However the company's inception as an auto manufacturer
						is usually </br> <br>
						recognized in 1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed.
						Ferrari is the world's most powerful brand according to Brand Finance.In May 2012 the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, selling in a private transaction for US$38.1 million to
						American communications magnate Craig McCaw.</br></p>

						<h2><span>History</span></h2>
						<p>Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. 
						Scuderia Ferrari (pronounced [skudeˈriːa]) literally means "Ferrari Stable" and is usually used to mean 
						"Team Ferrari." Ferrari bought, prepared and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for gentlemen drivers. In 1933
							Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia Ferrari took over as its works team:[1] the Scuderia received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of 
						the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. 
						In 1938 Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house,
						forming Alfa Corse in Milano and hired Enzo 
						Ferrari as manager of the new racing department;
						therefore the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded.
						
                        In September 1939 Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision 
						that he would not use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing 
						cars for at least four years.[1] A few days later he founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, 
						headquartered in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari.[1] The new company ostensibly 
						produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. In 1940 Ferrari did in fact produce a race
						car – the Tipo 815, based on a Fiat platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the
						1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943 the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. The factory was bombed by the Allies and subsequently rebuilt including a works for road car production.</p>

						<h2><span>MotorSport & Ferrari</span></h2>
						<p>Since the company's beginnings, Ferrari has been involved in motorsport, competing in a range of categories including Formula One and sports car racing through its Scuderia Ferrari sporting division as well as supplying cars and engines to other teams and for one make race series.
The 1940 AAC 815 was the first racing car to be designed by Enzo Ferrari,
 although it was not badged as a Ferrari model.</p>
